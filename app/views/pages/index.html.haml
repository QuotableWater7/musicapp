    %ul
      %li Don't practice any single exercise too long.  Depending on your total available practice time, you should spend no more than about 10-15 minutes on a single topic before taking a short break and then moving on to another activity.
      %li Always do warm ups before practicing things that require big stretches or fast playing
      %li Anticipate what sounds you will hear when playing.  The end goal is being able to play what you hear in your head.

      %p You know what music is?  God's little reminder that there is something else besides us in this universe; harmonic connection between all living beings, every where, even the stars.
