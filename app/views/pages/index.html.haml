      %li Don't practice any single thing too long.  I spend about 10-15 minutes on a topic before taking a short break and then moving on to another activity
      %li Always do warm ups before practicing things that require big stretches or fast playing
      %li Listen to what you are playing.  You will be surprised how much you can improve by simply being able to hum whatever you are playing

      %p You know what music is?  God's little reminder that there is something else besides us in this universe; harmonic connection between all living beings, every where, even the stars.
